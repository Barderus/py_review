Easy Exercises for LeetCode Preparation
Two Sum

Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
Example: Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9. Output: [0, 1].
Reverse Integer

Problem: Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse the digits of the integer.
Example: Input: 123, Output: 321.
Palindrome Number

Problem: Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
Example: Input: 121, Output: True.
Merge Two Sorted Lists

Problem: Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list.
Example: Input: l1 = [1, 2, 4], l2 = [1, 3, 4]. Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4].
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Problem: Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once.
Example: Input: [1, 1, 2]. Output: [1, 2].
Single Number

Problem: Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Example: Input: [2, 2, 1]. Output: 1.
Maximum Subarray

Problem: Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
Example: Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]. Output: 6.
Climbing Stairs

Problem: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. Find the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.
Example: Input: n = 3. Output: 3.
Valid Parentheses

Problem: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
Example: Input: "()[]{}". Output: True.
Count and Say

Problem: The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula: countAndSay(1) = "1". To generate the next term of the sequence, count the number of digits (in groups) and say the digits.
Example: Input: n = 4. Output: "1211".
